# HallC-Parser
First repository so please let me know something isn't configured right.

*WIP
This script should select run config data, and organize it to be uploaded with RCDB/CCDB script. Attached is a random EPICS log that I pulled just for testing purposes.
Feel free to change it as you see fit, it is still very basic and there are some portions of it that I am sure have a better way of being setup.
